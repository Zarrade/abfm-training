/* ABFM Training — automatic first drafts for new videos.
   Used by the daily GitHub job (scripts/draft.mjs) and by the admin "Auto-draft" button.
   Two ways of drafting:
   1. Gemini (if a free Gemini API key is set): it watches the YouTube video and writes the summary, safety note and steps.
   2. Built-in rules: summary from the YouTube description, steps from the video's chapters,
      safety note and PPE from the trade and keywords in the title.
